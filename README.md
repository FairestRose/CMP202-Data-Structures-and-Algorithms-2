CMP202 Data Structures and Algorithms 2 

Abertay University BSc Ethical Hacking Degree

Year 2 Term 2 

Assessment Unit 1 is a project worth 80% of the final grade, which requires creating parallel applications and
evaluating their performance. You are required to develop 2 Mini-Projects, one for CPU parallelisation and one
for GPU parallelisation. For each mini project, you will submit your C++ code plus a short report. The size of each mini project short
report ideally is 2-4 pages in PDF format, but you can exceed this up to 1-2 pages if needed.

For the first mini project, you will concentrate on CPU parallelization and will be required to develop a parallel
CPU application of your choice. Similarly, for the second mini project, you will develop a parallel GPU
application of your choice. Although you may decide to build upon and extend sample applications from the
labs, developing something completely new based on your idea is also an option for you. Once your application
is complete, you should measure its performance across a range of numbers or groupings of threads (and/or
different data size / different methods) where appropriate. In addition to developing and implementing the
application, you are also required to write a short report. This short report should provide a very brief introduction
to your application, its functionality, reasoning for algorithm selection, description of parallel design pattern,
implementation, and analysis of the application's performance (e.g., comparing execution time and speedup for
different numbers of threads, different data sizes, and algorithms, approaches such as sequential, different
parallelisation methods, etc.).

Assessment Unit 2 - You are required to complete two multiple-choice quizzes which will be available through MLS site of this
module. The quizzes will be published in Weeks 5 and 10 and will be worth 10% each of the final mark. While
there will be weekly quizzes from Week 2 to Week 10, only the quizzes from Weeks 5 and 10 will be assessed.
The quizzes for Weeks 5 and 10 will each consist of 20 multiple-choice questions, and you will have the
flexibility to complete these quizzes at any time before the deadline. It is important to note that you will only
be allowed one attempt to complete the quizzes, so you should take the tests when you feel fully prepared.
